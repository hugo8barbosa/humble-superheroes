# Humble Superheroes API and Frontend

This project consists of two main parts:

1. **Humble Superheroes API**: A backend application built with **NestJS** to provide a REST API for managing superheroes, their powers, and humility rankings.
2. **Frontend Application**: A React application built with **Vite** and **TypeScript** that interacts with the backend to display and create superheroes, allowing users to rank superheroes by humility.

## Project Structure

### Backend (Humble Superheroes API)

- **NestJS** is used for building the backend API, following MVC principles.
- Includes an endpoint to create superheroes
- Includes an endpoint to fetch superheroes sorted by humility in descending order.

### Frontend (Humble Superheroes Frontend)

- **React** and **Vite** are used for building a fast and reactive user interface.
- TypeScript is used for improved type safety and maintainability.
- Connects to the API to display superheroes and their humility rankings, and allows users to add new superheroes to the list.

### Disclaimer: Avatar Image Load Times

Please note that the avatar generation service used in this application may sometimes experience delays due to external factors. As a result, there may be instances where superhero avatars are missing or take longer to load.

## Communication and Transparency for Better Team Performance (Team Player Attitude)

For me, **communication and transparency** are critical to maintaining a healthy workflow and delivering great results in any team. In every project, clear and open communication helps in aligning goals, setting expectations, and avoiding unnecessary roadblocks. I would prioritize the following:

- **Frequent Updates**: Keeping the team updated on the progress, challenges, and any changes in approach ensures everyone is on the same page. This transparency minimizes confusion and maximizes efficiency.
- **Clear Documentation**: Ensuring all aspects of the project are well-documented, from codebases to API documentation, so that teammates can easily pick up where others left off and avoid miscommunication.
- **Active Feedback Loops**: Establishing a culture where feedback is encouraged and provided in a constructive manner. This ensures continuous improvement and adaptability throughout the project's lifecycle.

- **Open Communication Channels**: Whether through daily stand-ups, Slack channels, or regular check-ins, maintaining an open line of communication is key to quick problem-solving and decision-making.

By emphasizing **communication and transparency**, I believe the team can work harmoniously, improve workflow, and ultimately achieve higher quality and better results.

A well-organized and efficient workflow is essential for motivating a team, as it fosters a collaborative environment where each member can contribute effectively. This motivation leads to improved performance, ensuring that tasks are completed efficiently and to a high standard. By delivering quality work consistently, the team is able to meet client expectations, resulting in greater satisfaction and building long-term trust with clients.

<em>Motivated teams lead to happy clients!</em>

## Future work (Eagerness to Learn)

In the future I would explore the following:

- **Unit and Integration Tests**: Enhance testing coverage for both the frontend and backend, including testing edge cases and scenarios.
- **UI/UX Improvements**: Add more interactive UI elements such as animations, better accessibility features, and user-friendly error messages.
- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling and validation in both the API and the frontend, ensuring better user experience when something goes wrong.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement user authentication for role-based access to features such as creating or deleting superheroes.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Investigate possible performance optimizations, particularly for handling large amounts of superhero data.
- **Prisma Integration**: Implement Prisma ORM to improve database management and facilitate seamless querying, migrations, and better scalability of the backend.
- **Optimization possibilities:**
  1.  Indexing: Make sure the humility field is indexed in the database. Indexing allows the database to quickly look up and sort records without scanning the entire table.
  2.  Pagination: Instead of fetching all records at once, paginate the results. Use Prisma’s skip and take methods to fetch a smaller subset of the data per request. This reduces the load on both the database and the server.
  3.  Query Optimization: Use select to return only the necessary fields (like name, superpower, avatar) instead of fetching all columns. This reduces the data size being processed and returned.
  4.  Database Partitioning: If the data grows even larger, consider partitioning the database into smaller tables based on logical criteria (e.g., by date, region, etc.). This allows the database to handle smaller, more manageable chunks of data.
  5.  Caching: If the sorted list of superheroes doesn’t change often, implement caching strategies (e.g., with Redis) to store the result of commonly queried lists. This can dramatically reduce response times for repeated queries.
